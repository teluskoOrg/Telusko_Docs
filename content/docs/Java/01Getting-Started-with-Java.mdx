## What is Java?

Java is a **general-purpose, object-oriented programming language** created by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle).\
It is one of the most widely used languages for **web, desktop, and mobile applications**.

Java is known for its motto: **“Write Once, Run Anywhere”** — meaning code compiled on one system can run on any other system with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Why Learn Java?

* It powers **millions of applications** (banking systems, Android apps, enterprise software).
* It’s **platform independent** (runs on Windows, macOS, Linux).
* Huge ecosystem and community support.
* In-demand skills for **jobs in backend, mobile, and enterprise development**.

***

## Key Features of Java

* **Object-Oriented** – everything is structured around classes & objects.
* **Platform Independent** – JVM allows the same program to run on multiple systems.
* **Secure & Robust** – strong memory management and error handling.
* **Multithreaded** – supports running tasks in parallel.
* **Rich Libraries** – built-in APIs for networking, data, GUIs, etc.

## Getting Started with Java

Follow these steps to set up Java and run your first program.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Java">
    ## Why Install Java?

    Java programs require the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**.\
    The JDK includes tools to **compile** and **run** Java code.

    ## Installation Commands

    ```bash
    # macOS (Homebrew)
    brew install openjdk

    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk

    # Windows (winget)
    winget install Microsoft.OpenJDK.17
    ```

    ## Verify Installation

    Run this command to confirm:

    ```bash
    java -version
    ```

    You should see your installed version of Java.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your First Program">
    ## Create the File

    Open your editor and create a file named **`HelloWorld.java`**.

    ## Add the Code

    ```java
    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Notes

    * The filename must match the class name (`HelloWorld`).
    * `System.out.println` prints text to the screen.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compile Your Program">
    ## What is Compilation?

    Java code is not run directly — it is **compiled** into bytecode first.\
    This makes it platform-independent.

    ## Compile Command

    ```bash
    javac HelloWorld.java
    ```

    This creates a file called **`HelloWorld.class`**.

    ## Check for Errors

    If nothing is printed, it means the compilation was successful.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Your Program">
    ## Execute the Program

    Run the compiled class with:

    ```bash
    java HelloWorld
    ```

    (don’t add `.class` — just the class name).

    ## Expected Output

    ```
    Hello, Java!
    ```

    ## What’s Next?

    You’ve written, compiled, and run your first Java program!

    Next steps:

    * Try printing your name.
    * Add simple math (e.g., `System.out.println(2 + 3)`).
    * Explore **variables, loops, and conditions**.
  </Step>
</Steps>
