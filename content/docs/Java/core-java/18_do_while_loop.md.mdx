title: Do While Loop in Java

    ## Why Do-While Loop?

    * Sometimes we need a loop to **execute at least once**, even if the condition is false.
    * `do-while` loop guarantees **one execution first**, then checks the condition.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Syntax

    ```java
    do {
        // statements
    } while (condition);
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Example 1 ‚Äì Condition False but Runs Once

    ```java
    int i = 5;
    do {
        System.out.println("Hi " + i);
    } while (i <= 4);
    ```

    üëâ Output:

    ```
    Hi 5
    ```

    ‚ö° Even though `i <= 4` is **false**, loop runs **once**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Example 2 ‚Äì Works Same as While When Condition True

    ```java
    int i = 1;
    do {
        System.out.println("Hi " + i);
        i++;
    } while (i <= 4);
    ```

    üëâ Output:

    ```
    Hi 1
    Hi 2
    Hi 3
    Hi 4
    ```

    ‚úÖ Same result as `while` loop when condition is true.

    ## Key Difference: **while vs do-while**

    | Feature              | while loop                            | do-while loop                        |
    | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
    | Condition checked    | Before execution                      | After execution                      |
    | Executes at least 1? | ‚ùå Not guaranteed                      | ‚úÖ Guaranteed                         |
    | Usage                | When condition may be false initially | When we want execution at least once |
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## **Summary:**

    * `while` ‚Üí check first, then run.
    * `do-while` ‚Üí run first, then check.
  </Step>
