    ## Why Do We Need Loops?

    * In programs, we often need to do the **same task repeatedly**.
    * Using only `if-else` is not suitable â†’ it checks a condition only once.
    * Writing the same statement again and again is **cumbersome**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Example Without Loop

    ```java
    System.out.println("Hi");
    System.out.println("Hi");
    System.out.println("Hi");
    System.out.println("Hi");
    ```

    ðŸ‘‰ Very repetitive and not efficient.
  </Step>

    ## Example With Loop

    ```java
    for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
        System.out.println("Hi");
    }
    ```

    ðŸ‘‰ Much shorter and easier to maintain.

    ## Loops in Java

    Java provides **3 main types of loops**:

    1. **for loop** â†’ repeat code a fixed number of times.
    2. **while loop** â†’ repeat code while a condition is true.
    3. **do-while loop** â†’ similar to while, but executes at least once.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## **Key Idea:**

    Loops make code **clean, efficient, and dynamic** â†’ we can run tasks multiple times **programmatically** instead of manually repeating code.
