title: Variables in Python

<Steps>
  <Step>
    A variable is a named container used to store data (value).\
    In Python, variables are created automatically when a value is assigned to them.

    ### Example:

    ```python
    x = 2          # x is the variable, 2 is the value
    print(x + 3)   # Output: 5

    y = 3
    print(x + y)   # Output: 5
    ```

    * Variables are **mutable**, meaning their values can be changed during execution.

    ```python
    x = 9
    print(x)      # Output: 9
    print(x + y)  # Output: 12
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Accessing Undefined Variables

    If you try to use a variable that is not defined, Python throws a **NameError**.

    ### Example:

    ```python
    abc
    # Traceback (most recent call last):
    # NameError: name 'abc' is not defined. Did you mean: 'abs'?
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Using the Underscore `_`

    Python automatically stores the result of the last executed expression in the variable `_`.

    ### Example:

    ```python
    x = 5
    y = 3
    x + y        # Output: 8
    _ + y        # Output: 11 (since _ stores previous output 8)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Strings as Variables

    * Strings in Python can be written using **single (‘ ’)** or **double (“ ”)** quotes.
    * Variables can store string values just like numbers.

    ### Example:

    ```python
    name = "youtube"
    print(name)             # Output: youtube
    print(name + " rocks")  # Output: youtube rocks
    ```

    Incorrect concatenation:

    ```python
    print(name ' rocks')  # SyntaxError
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## String Indexing and Slicing

    ### (a) Positive Indexing

    Each character in a string has an index:

    ```
    y   o   u   t   u   b   e
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    ```

    ### (b) Negative Indexing

    Python also supports negative indexing:

    ```
    y   o   u   t   u   b   e
    -7 -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
    ```

    ### Examples:

    ```python
    name = "youtube"

    print(name[0])     # 'y'
    print(name[6])     # 'e'
    print(name[-1])    # 'e'

    print(name[0:2])   # 'yo'  (characters from index 0 to 1)
    print(name[1:4])   # 'out'
    print(name[1:])    # 'outube' (from index 1 till end)
    print(name[:4])    # 'yout'
    print(name[3:10])  # 'tube' (index out of range is ignored)
    print(name[-5:-2]) # 'utu'
    ```

    ### Special Cases:

    ```python
    print(name[:])     # 'youtube'  (entire string)
    print(name[:0])    # '' (empty string)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Strings are Immutable

    In Python, **strings cannot be modified** once created.\
    Attempting to assign new characters to existing string indices results in an error.

    ### Example:

    ```python
    name = "youtube"
    name[0] = "r"  
    # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## String Concatenation

    Strings can be joined using the `+` operator.

    ### Example:

    ```python
    name = "youtube"
    print("my " + name[3:])   # Output: my tube
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Built-in Function: `len()`

    The `len()` function returns the total number of characters in a string.

    ### Example:

    ```python
    myname = "Navin Reddy"
    print(len(myname))   # Output: 11
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Summary

    * Variables are containers for values and can be reassigned.
    * Using an undefined variable raises a NameError.
    * `_` stores the last evaluated result.
    * Strings can be assigned, concatenated, sliced, and indexed.
    * Strings are **immutable** (cannot be changed after creation).
    * `len()` is used to find the length of a string.
