    ## Python Interpreter and an IDE

    To build software or applications, we need:

    * A **Python Interpreter** → to run Python code.
    * An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** → to write, test, debug, and run code efficiently.

    Popular IDEs for Python:

    * PyCharm (by JetBrains) – most popular for Python.
    * VS Code
    * Anaconda
    * Python IDLE (comes with Python).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Installing Python Interpreter and PyCharm

    ### Step 1: Check if Python is Already Installed

    Open **Command Prompt (CMD)** and run:

    ```bash
    python --version
    python3 --version
    ```

    If you see an error like this, then Python is not installed:

    ```bash
    Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store...
    ```

    ### Step 2: Download Python

    * Visit the official site: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Select the latest stable version (based on your OS: Windows, Mac, Linux).
    * Run the installer.

    > Check the option "Add Python.exe to PATH" during installation. This ensures Python commands work in the terminal.

    ### Step 3: Verify Installation

    After installation, check again in CMD:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    Example Output:

    ```bash
    Python 3.11.5
    ```

    ### Step 4: Install PyCharm (IDE)

    * Download from: [PyCharm Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Versions:
      * Community Edition (Free) → Best for beginners.
      * Professional Edition (Paid) → Advanced features for enterprise use.

    For learning, you can choose Community Edition.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Testing Python

    After Python installation, try running Python in the terminal:

    ```bash
    >>> 2 + 3
    5
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Using PyCharm

    1. Open PyCharm → Create a New Project.
    2. Choose a location for your project (e.g., C:\Users\YourName\PycharmProjects\MyFirstProject).
    3. Select the installed Python Interpreter.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Conclusion

    * Python interpreter is required to execute Python code.
    * An IDE like PyCharm makes development easier with debugging, code completion, and project management.
