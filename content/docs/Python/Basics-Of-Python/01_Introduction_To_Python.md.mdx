    ## Why Python?

    Python is one of the **fastest-growing programming languages** in the world. Its popularity is driven by:

    * A large number of libraries and frameworks.
    * Wide adoption by companies across industries.
    * Its versatility in multiple domains such as:
      * Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
      * Web Development
      * GUI Applications
      * Software Development

    Because of this, Python is often called a **general-purpose language**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## What is Python?

    Python is a **high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language**.

    ### Key Characteristics:

    * **Interpreted:** Code is executed line by line (no need for compilation).
    * **Object-Oriented:** Supports classes, objects, and principles like inheritance and encapsulation.
    * **Supports Multiple Paradigms:**
      * Procedural Programming
      * Object-Oriented Programming
    * **Beginner-Friendly:** Its syntax is simple and closer to natural language, making it the easiest programming language to learn and use.

    ## History of Python

    * **Created by:** *Guido van Rossum* in **1989**.
    * **Name Origin:** Inspired by the British comedy show *“Monty Python’s Flying Circus”*.
    * **First Release:** Python 1.0 in January 1994.

    ### Major Versions:

    * **Python 1.0** → January 1994
    * **Python 2.0** → October 2000
    * **Python 3.0** → December 2008

    > **Note:** Python 3.x is **not fully backward-compatible** with Python 2.x, which is why both versions existed side by side for a long time. However, Python 3.x is the latest and recommended version with more features and long-term support.

    ## Python in the Industry

    Python is widely used by top companies:

    * **Google, Dropbox, YouTube, Yahoo** → use Python as a core or support language.
    * **Reddit** → entirely built with Python.

    This strong industry adoption makes Python one of the most valuable skills for developers today.
  </Step>
