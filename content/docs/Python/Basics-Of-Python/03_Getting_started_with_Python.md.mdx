  <Step>
    Python is a high-level, interpreted language designed to be easy to read and write. The interpreter translates Python code into bytecode and executes it, ultimately running machine-level instructions.

    We use programming languages like Python because computers only understand binary (0s and 1s), programming languages provide a human-friendly way to write instructions that get translated into machine code.

    We're using Python IDLE in this lecture as **Python IDLE** is a simple environment where you can run code interactively or save scripts as .py files and execute them from an editor or terminal.

    ## Airthmetic Operations

    Python supports the standard arithmetic operators. Below each operator is explained and illustrated with examples and expected output.

    ### Addition `+`

    ```python
    >>> 2 + 3
    5
    ```

    *Adds two numbers.*

    ### Subtraction `-`

    ```python
    >>> 9 - 8
    1
    ```

    *Subtracts the right-hand operand from the left-hand operand.*

    ### Multiplication `*`

    ```python
    >>> 4 * 6
    24
    ```

    *Multiplies operands.*

    ### True division `/` (returns `float`)

    * The division operator `/` always returns a float even if both operands are integers.

    ```python
    >>> 8 / 4
    2.0
    >>> 5 / 2
    2.5
    ```

    *This is useful because division can produce non-integer results; returning a float preserves precision.*

    ### Floor (integer) division `//`

    * Use `//` if you want only the integer part (the quotient) and to discard any fractional remainder.

    ```python
    >>> 10 // 3
    3
    >>> -7 // 3
    -3  # floor division rounds toward negative infinity
    ```

    > Note: with negative numbers `//` performs floor division — results may look unintuitive if you expect truncation toward zero.\*

    ### Modulus `%` (remainder)

    ```python
    >>> 10 % 3
    1
    ```

    *Returns remainder of division.*

    ### Exponentiation `**`

    ```python
    >>> 2 ** 3
    8
    >>> 4 ** 0.5
    2.0  # square root
    ```

    *Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.*

    ### Operator precedence and parentheses

    Python obeys the usual mathematical rules (BODMAS). Use parentheses to change order.

    ```python
    >>> 8 + 2 * 3
    14
    >>> (8 + 2) * 3
    30
    ```

    **Common pitfall:** incomplete expressions cause syntax errors:

    ```python
    >>> 8 + 9 -
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Strings

    A **string** is a sequence of characters. Strings can be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`, double quotes `"..."`, or triple quotes for multi-line strings `'''...'''` or `"""..."""`.

    ### Single and double quotes

    Both are equivalent, choose whichever avoids the need to escape characters.

    ```python
    >>> print('navin')
    navin
    >>> print("navin")
    navin
    ```

    ### Using quotes inside strings

    * If the string contains an apostrophe, use double quotes outside to avoid escaping.

    ```python
    >>> print("navin's laptop")
    navin's laptop
    ```

    * If you must use the same quote inside and outside, escape the inner quote with a backslash `\`.

    ```python
    >>> print('navin\'s "laptop"')
    navin's "laptop"
    ```

    ### Triple-quoted strings (multi-line)

    ```python
    text = '''This is a
    multi-line string.'''
    print(text)
    ```

    ### Escaping special characters

    The backslash `\` introduces escape sequences like `\n` (newline), `\\` (a literal backslash), `\t` (tab), etc.

    ```python
    >>> print('Line1\nLine2')
    Line1
    Line2
    ```

    **Common error**: mismatched quotes cause `SyntaxError`:

    ```python
    >>> print('navin's laptop')
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Functions

    A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task. Python has many built-in functions (e.g., `print()`, `len()`) and you can define your own, which we will discuss in more detail later in the course.

    ### Built-in function example

    ```python
    >>> len('hello')
    5
    >>> print('Hello, world!')
    Hello, world!
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Concatenation and Repetition of strings

    ### Concatenation using `+`

    Joins two strings into one. Both operands must be strings.

    ```python
    >>> 'navin' + ' reddy'
    'navin reddy'
    ```

    ### Repetition using `*`

    Repeats a string multiple times.

    ```python
    >>> 'navin ' * 3
    'navin navin navin '
    ```

    **Type error example**:

    ```python
    >>> 'navin' + 5
    TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## 6. New line character and raw strings

    ### `\n` — newline character

    `\n` in a string inserts a newline when printed.

    ```python
    >>> print('c:\\docs\navin')
    c:\docs
    avin
    ```

    ### Raw strings `r'...'`

    Raw strings treat backslashes `\\` as literal characters. Useful for file paths or regular expressions.

    ```python
    >>> print(r'c:\docs\navin')
    c:\docs\navin
    ```

    > **Note:** A raw string cannot end with a single backslash (`r"something\"` is invalid). Use normal strings or escape the final backslash.
