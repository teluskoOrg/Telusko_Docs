## What is Python?

Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.\
It is popular for its **simplicity, readability, and versatility**, making it a great choice for beginners and professionals alike.

Python is widely used in **web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scripting, and automation**.

***

## Why Learn Python?

* Beginner-friendly syntax (close to plain English).
* Rapid development for projects of any size.
* Huge community and open-source ecosystem.
* Popular in data science, AI, and machine learning.
* Powers websites (Django, Flask) and tools at companies like Google, Instagram, Netflix.

***

## Key Features of Python

* **Easy to Learn** – minimal syntax, highly readable.
* **Cross-Platform** – runs on Windows, macOS, Linux.
* **Interpreted** – no need for compilation, runs line by line.
* **Extensive Libraries** – NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Flask, Django, and more.
* **Versatile** – from small scripts to enterprise applications.

## Getting Started with Python

Follow these steps to install Python and run your first program.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Python">
    ## Why Install Python?

    Python is required to run and write Python programs.\
    Most Linux/macOS systems already have it pre-installed, but you may want the latest version.

    ## Installation Commands

    ```bash
    # macOS (Homebrew)
    brew install python

    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3

    # Windows (winget)
    winget install Python.Python.3.12
    ```

    ## Verify Installation

    Run this command to confirm:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

    You should see the installed version of Python.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your First Program">
    ## Create the File

    Open your editor and create a file named **`hello.py`**.

    ## Add the Code

    ```python
    print("Hello, Python!")
    ```

    ## Notes

    * No need for a `main` method — Python runs top to bottom.
    * Indentation is **critical** in Python (use spaces consistently).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Your Program">
    ## Execute the Program

    Run your Python script with:

    ```bash
    python hello.py
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    python3 hello.py
    ```

    ## Expected Output

    ```
    Hello, Python!
    ```

    ## What’s Next?

    You’ve written and run your first Python program!

    Next steps:

    * Print your name.
    * Do simple math: `print(2 + 3)`.
    * Learn about **variables, loops, and functions**.
  </Step>
