    ## 1. Tuples

    A **tuple** is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list, but unlike lists, tuples are **immutable**, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.

    **Creating a Tuple:**

    ```python
    tup = (21, 36, 14, 25)
    print(tup)
    # Output: (21, 36, 14, 25)
    ```

    **Accessing Elements:**

    ```python
    print(tup[1])
    # Output: 36
    ```

    **Immutability:**

    ```python
    tup[1] = 33
    # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
    ```

    **Tuple Method (count):**

    **`count(element)`** â€“ Returns the number of occurrences of an element in the tuple.

    ```python
    tup = (5, 2, 5, 7)
    print(tup.count(5))
    # Output: 2
    ```

    ### Iteration

    Iterating over tuples is faster than lists, making them suitable for scenarios where performance is critical and data should remain constant.

    ### When to use Tuples

    * When you need an ordered collection of elements that should not be changed.
    * When iteration speed is important, as tuples are more efficient than lists.

    ## 2. Sets

    A **set** is a collection of **unique elements** that is **unordered**. Sets do not allow duplicates and do not maintain the sequence of elements.

    **Creating a Set:**

    ```python
    s = {22, 25, 14, 21, 5}
    print(s)
    # Output: {5, 21, 22, 25, 14}  # Order may vary
    ```

    **Duplicate Elements:**

    ```python
    s = {25, 14, 98, 63, 75, 98}
    print(s)
    # Output: {98, 25, 75, 14, 63}
    ```

    ### Properties of Sets

    * **Unordered:** Elements do not maintain the sequence.
    * **Unique Elements:** No duplicates allowed.
    * **Indexing Not Supported:**

    ```python
    s[2]
    # TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable
    ```

    * **Hash-Based:** Sets use hashing for fast access and efficient performance.
    * **Mutability:** While the set itself is mutable (you can add or remove elements), you cannot change a specific element because there is no indexing.

    ### When to use Sets

    * When you need a collection of unique elements.
    * When the order of elements does not matter.
