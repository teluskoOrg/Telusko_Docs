## What is React?

React is a **JavaScript library** developed by Facebook for building **user interfaces**.\
It focuses on building reusable components that make managing complex UIs simpler and more efficient.

React is widely used in **web applications**, from small projects to large-scale enterprise apps.

***

## Why Learn React?

* One of the most popular JavaScript libraries.
* Backed by a huge community and companies like Meta.
* Reusable **component-based architecture**.
* Excellent performance with **virtual DOM**.
* Works with libraries and frameworks like **Next.js** for production-ready apps.

***

## Key Features of React

* **Component-Based** – build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
* **Declarative Syntax** – describe UI and React updates it efficiently.
* **Virtual DOM** – improves performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulation.
* **Unidirectional Data Flow** – predictable data handling.
* **Rich Ecosystem** – supports routing, state management, and server rendering.

## Getting Started with React

Follow these steps to set up React and create your first app.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Node.js">
    ## Why Install Node.js?

    React requires **Node.js** and **npm (Node Package Manager)** to run development servers and manage dependencies.

    ## Installation Commands

    ```bash
    # macOS (Homebrew)
    brew install node

    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nodejs npm

    # Windows (winget)
    winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
    ```

    ## Verify Installation

    Run these commands to confirm:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a React App">
    ## Using Vite (recommended)

    Create a new React project with:

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest my-app
    ```

    Choose **React** (or **React + TypeScript**) when prompted.

    Then install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd my-app
    npm install
    ```

    ## Alternative (Create React App)

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-app
    cd my-app
    npm start
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Development Server">
    Start the dev server with:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open your browser at:

    ```
    http://localhost:5173
    ```

    You should see the default React app running.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your First Component">
    ## Create a Component

    Inside `src/`, create a file **`Hello.jsx`**:

    ```jsx
    function Hello() {
      return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
    }

    export default Hello;
    ```

    ## Use the Component

    Update `src/App.jsx`:

    ```jsx
    import Hello from './Hello';

    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <Hello />
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

    ## Run Again

    Save the files and refresh the browser.\
    You should see:

    ```
    Hello, React!
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
